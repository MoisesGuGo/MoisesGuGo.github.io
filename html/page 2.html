            <p>
                This game can be very overwhelming for 
                the player with the large number of systems 
                you have. Here are some tips that can make 
                your first game easier. during the
                first hours of playing in your world.

                        <h3>Crouch every time you move</h3>
                        <p>First of all, always stay crouching, 
                            the zombies in this game are not 
                            deaf, and will detect any noise they 
                            hear around them. By crouching down 
                            we will greatly reduce the noise we 
                            generate when walking, which will 
                            allow us to move more easily between 
                            houses and narrow areas.

                    <h3>Take only the essential</h3>
                    <p>
                        When we start, the first thing we must do 
                        is to get food, clothes and weapons, but 
                        we can't let stress dominate us and start 
                        taking everything we see as if we had Diogenes 
                        syndrome. In doing so, our mobility will be 
                        reduced as we carry a lot of weight and we 
                        will not be able to carry things that could 
                        be useful to us such as tools or blunt weapons.
                        We will always take a little of everything 
                        we are going to need in the short term, such 
                        as food, water bottles that we can refill, 
                        medical supplies, etc.

                    <p>
                        The most normal thing is that after a while of 
                        collecting and exploring is that we have already 
                        found a place to stay. In case it is a house with 
                        television, we will always leave it on with the 
                        volume at the minimum, this will help us to increase 
                        our skills much faster, since from time to time they 
                        will show cooking or carpentry programs that will give 
                        us experience in that profession.

                    <p>
                        Water is the most important resource to take 
                        into account, so we must always have some simple 
                        way to collect and store it. When we go collecting,
                         we will look for plastic bottles, barrels or buckets 
                         in which to pour water. It is best to make our 
                         base near a river, since these provide us with 
                         an unlimited water source.

                        <h3>Avoid firearms</h3>
                        <p>
                            It is tempting to use firearms to defend ourselves 
                            because of their great power, but in this situation 
                            they are the opposite. We will avoid using this type 
                            of weapons whenever we can, since their ammunition is 
                            very scarce, and above all because they generate a lot 
                            of noise that will attract all the zombies to your area 
                            making you lose control of the situation. It is 
                            preferable to use bladed weapons as they are silent, can 
                            be repaired quite easily, and are plentiful all over the world.

                        whenever you travel and raid large cities. 
                        Maps provide a lot of information about what 
                        is contained in the rooms you see. This way 
                        you can better plan your next outing by prioritizing 
                        places of interest for loot that may be of 
                        use to you, such as fire stations for generators 
                        or police stations for sturdy and durable clothing.

                        Having a car is a great advantage for you 
                        and your base. During the first few hours of 
                        the game try to look for vehicles that are 
                        not too damaged and are able to function 
                        because you will be able to carry more things 
                        to your base during your outings, and you 
                        will be able to move even further that you
