            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Project Zomboid is a zombie apocalypse
                survival videogame, even though it has
                been in development for 10 years, the
                game has a lot of content and is very
                popular among its community. Project Zomboid
                is a game that at first can be very complex
                and difficult due to its high learning curve,
                and sometimes because of this, many users who
                start playing it get frustrated and stop playing
                it. That's what this website is here for, to
                help you make your gameplay easier during the
                first hours of playing in your world.

                        <h3>Do not force yourself</h3>
                        <p>
                            It is very easy to be forced to play after
                            your friends tell you so much about it, but
                            you don't have to. It is understandable that
                            the decision to invest money and above all
                            a lot of time to enjoy this game. Don't be
                            forced to play it just to get it off your to-play
                            list. Project Zomboid is not for everyone, its
                            graphic style, its rough mechanics, the slowness
                            of its systems, is not very appealing at first,
                            but if you give it a chance it can be one
                            of your favorite games.

                    <p>
                        Playing with friends, your experience in the game
                        improves a lot, since the game rewards organization
                        and joint planning, thus increasing your chances
                        of survival. With friends most of its mechanics
                        become more bearable and lighter. While someone
                        explores to collect food and resources, you and
                        another companion can dedicate yourselves to
                        climb professions, improve the shelter, clean
                        the surroundings of "zeds". Also, playing together
                        offers a totally different and more rewarding
                        experience that can gradually encourage you to
                        take the game more seriously, such as playing
                        with new ideas, or even venturing out on your own.

                    <p>
                        This game is tough and complicated. It will not
                        forgive you a single mistake. You may think you
                        already know the basics, you know how to move
                        carefully, you have enough food for a while,
                        you have a secure base, but everything can go
                        wrong in a matter of seconds. This game can be
                        frustrating on many occasions, but every time
                        you make a mistake it punishes you so hard,
                        that the game knows you won't make that same
                        mistake again the next time you find yourself
                        in similar situations.
